# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:

##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "✅ TECHNICAL FEATURES DISPLAY VERIFIED: Motorcycle cards display technical specifications including engine capacity (cc), horsepower (hp), year, and price. Tested multiple cards - majority show technical data correctly. Found technical specs like '243cc 26hp', '155cc 19hp', '124cc 13hp' displayed under motorcycle information. Cards show manufacturer, model, category, and pricing. Minor: First card in some cases missing technical specs, but overall technical features display is functional."

Default 'Most Popular' option implements dual-level sorting (year descending, then price ascending). Sorting functionality tested and working - motorcycles reorder when different sort options selected. Sort controls properly highlighted and functional."

Browse page also shows 2614 motorcycles instead of expected 1307. This indicates the frontend is not properly using the stats API data or there's a calculation error in the statistics display logic.

Homepage shows 2614+ motorcycles instead of expected 1307+ from backend. Browse page also displays 2614 motorcycles count. Manufacturer count shows 2614+ instead of expected 5+ manufacturers. This indicates frontend statistics API integration is not working correctly - either the stats API is returning wrong data or frontend is not properly processing the API response.

        comment: "❌ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Comprehensive API testing reveals the backend stats API is actually returning 2614 motorcycles, not 1307 as expected. The frontend is correctly displaying the backend data. The issue is in the backend database - it contains 2614 motorcycles instead of the expected 1307. Backend APIs (/api/stats, /api/motorcycles, /api/motorcycles/categories/summary) all consistently return 2614 total motorcycles. However, manufacturer count correctly shows 5+ as expected. The data discrepancy is a backend database issue, not a frontend display problem."

(2) Dual-Level Sorting Implementation - Default sorting correctly implements year descending (newest first) then price ascending (lowest first), produces different results than single-field sorting, custom sorting still functional. (3) Database Count Verification - 1307 motorcycles maintained, all major manufacturers properly counted (Yamaha: 319, Honda: 297, Kawasaki: 309, Suzuki: 274, Ducati: 108).
