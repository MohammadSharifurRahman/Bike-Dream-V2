# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED (January 31st, 2025):
✅ Search Functionality Fix - Search autocomplete now works perfectly with multiple suggestions for manufacturers and models (e.g., "ninja" shows 8 suggestions, "honda" shows manufacturer with 594 results). Homepage search now properly navigates to browse page with applied filters.
✅ Region Filter Responsiveness Fix - Region filter now responds properly to all changes, updates motorcycle counts and pricing correctly across multiple selections. Homepage region filtering working properly and carrying over to browse page.
✅ Image Loading Issue Fix - Significantly improved from 20+ loading images to only 5. Added timeout mechanism and better error handling. Authentic motorcycle images now display properly (Kawasaki Ninja H2, Ducati Panigale V4, Yamaha YZF-R1 confirmed working)

    message: "🎯 TECHNICAL FEATURES & DUAL-LEVEL SORTING TESTING COMPLETED: Successfully tested both requested enhancements with 100% success rate (66/66 tests passed)! Comprehensive testing covered: (1) Technical Features Database Enhancement - All 1307 motorcycles now have complete technical features (mileage_kmpl, transmission_type, number_of_gears, ground_clearance_mm, seat_height_mm, abs_available, braking_system, suspension_type, tyre_type, wheel_size_inches, headlight_type, fuel_type), field consistency verified with 'specialisations' field usage, Suzuki and Ducati motorcycles have complete technical data, technical features filtering operational, numeric range filtering working for mileage/ground clearance/seat height. (2) Dual-Level Sorting Implementation - Default sorting correctly implements year descending (newest first) then price ascending (lowest first), produces different results than single-field sorting, custom sorting still functional. (3) Database Count Verification - 1307 motorcycles maintained, all major manufacturers properly counted (Yamaha: 319, Honda: 297, Kawasaki: 309, Suzuki: 274, Ducati: 108).
