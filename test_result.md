# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "🎯 USER INTERACTION APIS TESTING COMPLETED: Successfully tested all 11 new user interaction APIs with 97.9% success rate (46/47 tests passed)! Comprehensive testing covered: (1) Authentication & User Management - POST /api/auth/profile and GET /api/auth/me working perfectly with Emergent session data, (2) Favorites System - POST/DELETE /api/motorcycles/{id}/favorite and GET /api/motorcycles/favorites all functional, (3) Rating System - POST /api/motorcycles/{id}/rate and GET /api/motorcycles/{id}/ratings working correctly, (4) Comments & Discussion - POST /api/motorcycles/{id}/comment, GET /api/motorcycles/{id}/comments, and POST /comments/{id}/like all operational, (5) Browse Limit Fix - GET /api/motorcycles with limit=3000 returns all 1307 motorcycles in database. Fixed ObjectId serialization issues in ratings and comments endpoints. Only minor discrepancy: database contains 1307 motorcycles (not 2614+ as expected), but system correctly returns all available data when high limits are requested. All user engagement features are production-ready."

    message: "Updated Suzuki and Ducati motorcycles with detailed technical features and renamed 'features' to 'specialisations' for consistency. Implemented dual-level sorting: new bikes to old bikes (year desc), then low to high price (price asc). Ready for backend testing to verify the enhanced database data and new sorting functionality."
