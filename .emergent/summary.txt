The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the Bike-Dream application from MVP to a feature-rich product through iterative development. Initially, efforts focused on enhancing search, adding a comparison tool, and implementing user roles with a dynamic banner. Following user feedback, the engineer systematically addressed a comprehensive list of ten priority issues. Key challenges involved debugging frontend-backend data inconsistencies, particularly with motorcycle ratings, duplicate listings, and image loading. The engineer employed a systematic debugging approach, using screenshots, console logs, and direct API tests to diagnose and resolve problems. This involved refining API endpoints, updating frontend components for data display and filtering, and repeatedly re-evaluating solutions, especially for the persistent image loading issue, which required several attempts from external URLs to base64, then CSS placeholders, and finally to optimized authentic images. The region filtering and image loading issues proved to be particularly stubborn, requiring deep debugging of frontend state, backend API logic, and environmental factors (like preview server caching).

<product_requirements>
The Bike-Dream application aims to be a comprehensive platform for motorcycle enthusiasts, offering a database of 2614+ models with detailed specifications and images from 1900 to present.
**Core Functionalities & Initial Scope:** Robust user authentication (email/password, Google OAuth 2.0, JWT, session management), advanced search, filtering, and sorting. Localization with real-time, multi-vendor pricing across 67+ countries and 50+ currencies. User interactions like personal favorites, a 5-star rating system, threaded comments, and automated daily data updates. A responsive UI/UX with a dynamic homepage, image carousel, and professional image handling. Recent additions include user activity analytics, improved navigation, user request submission, a virtual garage, price alerts, rider groups, and an achievement system.

**Recent Development Requirements & Implementations:**
1.  **Motorcycle Search with Auto-Suggestion**: Site-wide search by model and brand with dynamic autocomplete.
2.  **Motorcycle Comparison Tool**: Side-by-side comparison of up to 3 motorcycles with detailed info in a modal.
3.  **Toggle to Hide Discontinued/Unavailable Bikes**: Filter button on listing pages.
4.  **Scrolling Text Banner**: Dynamic banner for promotions, configurable via admin panel.
5.  **User Role Management**: Admin, Moderator, User roles with RBAC and admin dashboard.
6.  **Fix Rating Display Issue**: Ensure consistent and accurate display of seeded ratings.
7.  **Eliminate Duplicate Bike Listings**: Display unique models based on lowest price on homepage/category pages.
8.  **Remove Made with Emergent Branding**: Clean website interface.
9.  **Add Custom Contact Footer**: Non-intrusive disclaimer with contact email.
10. **User Request Aggregation & Email Notification System**: Backend storage for requests, daily compilation, 90-day archive (email integration skipped).
11. **Add Social Sharing & Community Engagement Block**: Section below banner for social buttons and CTA.
12. **Add Country-Specific Filtering Option**: Filter listings based on user's country.
13. **Fix Motorcycle Images**: Ensure authentic, model-specific pictures are displayed.
14. **My Garage Functionality**: Ensure favorites, owned, and wishlist sections work correctly.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI application, managing API endpoints, database interactions, and business logic.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        *   **Rating Display**: Added a dedicated endpoint  to seed sample ratings; ensured  and  are included in responses.
        *   **Hide Unavailable/Duplicate Listings**: Modified  and  endpoints to accept  and  parameters, and to group motorcycles by model to eliminate duplicates, showing the lowest price.
        *   **User Request Aggregation**: Added  model and API endpoints ( for submission,  for management,  for data export,  for archiving). Removed duplicate old  endpoint.
        *   **Motorcycle Images**: Added  endpoint to update image URLs, supporting both external (Unsplash/Pexels) and later base64 encoded images.
        *   **Stats API**: Modified  to accept  and  parameters for dynamic statistics.
        *   **Region Mapping**: Updated internal region mappings (e.g., adding KTM to India's manufacturers).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into troubleshooting a critical image loading issue and an inconsistent region filtering behavior reported by the user.

For the **Image Loading Issue (Priority 9)**:
*   Initially, the engineer updated motorcycle images with new URLs from Unsplash/Pexels, which were optimized for size and format. This was successful in local testing.
*   However, the user reported images were still not loading in the preview, showing loading for long time then broken link symbol.
*   Debugging revealed several layers of issues:
    *   Backend API calls were failing due to a perceived backend URL mismatch or blocking in the preview environment (though later  and other endpoints were confirmed working on preview).
    *   Attempts were made to use base64 encoded images to bypass CORS/loading issues, but this also failed to display images, showing Loading... placeholders. The root cause here was identified as the  component's  event not firing for base64 images, keeping  true.
    *   Further debugging revealed the preview API was *not* returning base64 images despite a previous update attempt; it was still serving external URLs, leading to continued  states.
    *   A bulletproof solution using a CSS-only motorcycle placeholder with an inline SVG was implemented to ensure *something* always displays instantly, resolving the broken link symbols and persistent Loading... messages. This was later reverted as the user explicitly requested *authentic images*, not placeholders.
    *   The latest attempt involved re-sourcing and re-uploading authentic, high-quality images from Unsplash and Pexels with optimized URLs to both local and preview environments. This showed partial success, with many images loading but some still in Loading... state.
*   The user's very last feedback explicitly states: Still no image is coming. First it shows loading for some time then the broken link simble comes. and When I click any of them the image came are still not authentic picture of the motorcycle of the specific motorcycle model. This implies the previously implemented fixes are not holding up in the preview environment, and the core issue persists despite multiple attempts.

For the **Region Filter Inconsistency**:
*   The user reported that the Show motorcycles available in button is not responsive to region changes after the first selection.
*   The engineer acknowledged this as a classic React state management issue.

The current state is that the image loading is still problematic for the user, and the region filter responsiveness needs investigation.
