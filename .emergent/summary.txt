The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Bike-Dream application from an initial MVP to a comprehensive, feature-rich platform. The development trajectory focused on iterative implementation and rigorous testing, addressing explicit user requests across multiple phases.
Phase 1 centered on enhancing search and filtering capabilities, introducing site-wide motorcycle search with auto-suggestions by model and brand, and a toggle to hide discontinued or unavailable bikes. This involved significant backend API modifications in  and new component integration in , alongside debugging frontend runtime errors related to DOM manipulation.
Phase 2 introduced a motorcycle comparison tool, requiring new backend endpoints for multi-motorcycle data retrieval and complex frontend state management for selection, display, and modal interactions. This phase also involved debugging API call formats.
Phase 3 implemented robust user role management (Admin, Moderator, User) with RBAC, and a dynamic, admin-controlled scrolling text banner for promotions. This necessitated updates to the user model, new backend APIs, and integration of an admin dashboard with corresponding frontend components. Each phase concluded with successful backend and frontend testing, ensuring stability and functionality.

-   **UI/UX**: Responsive design, dynamic homepage with real-time stats, sliding image carousel, professional image handling.
-   **Recent Additions**: User activity analytics, improved navigation, user request submission, virtual garage, price alerts, rider groups, and an achievement system to foster community and enable monetization.

**New Requirements (as of Chat Message 5 & 8):**
1.  **Motorcycle Search with Auto-Suggestion**: Site-wide search by model name and brand with dynamic autocomplete suggestions.
2.  **Motorcycle Comparison Tool**: Allow side-by-side comparison of up to 3 motorcycles, displaying specs, vendor availability, pricing, ratings, and images in a new modal.
3.  **Toggle to Hide Discontinued/Unavailable Bikes**: A filter button on key listing pages (Homepage, Browse All, Category pages).
4.  **Scrolling Text Banner**: Dynamic banner below the homepage carousel for vendor discounts, promotions, and admin updates, configurable via a simple admin panel interface.
5.  **User Role Management**: Implement Admin, Moderator, and User roles with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) across the application and a separate admin dashboard.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully completed Phase 3 of the development cycle, which focused on implementing User Role Management (RBAC) and a dynamic Scrolling Text Banner for the Bike-Dream application.

For **User Role Management**:
-   **Backend ()**: The  model was updated to include a  field. New RBAC middleware functions (, ) were added to enforce access control. API endpoints were created under  for listing users and updating their roles (e.g., changing a user's role to 'admin' or 'moderator').
-   **Frontend ()**: An  component was created to provide a UI for user management, including a list of users and the ability to modify their roles. An  was added to the main navigation, visible only to users with appropriate roles, which toggles the  modal. API calls from the frontend for role updates were debugged and fixed to correctly match the backend's expected path parameter format.

For **Scrolling Text Banner**:
-   **Backend ()**:  models were introduced, and CRUD API endpoints were created under  allowing administrators to add, update, delete, and retrieve banner messages.
-   **Frontend ()**: A  component was created and integrated into the homepage, positioned directly below the main hero carousel. This banner dynamically displays messages fetched from the backend, providing a real-time feed for promotions and updates. Minor CSS adjustments were made to ensure proper styling.

Both backend and frontend implementations for Phase 3 were comprehensively tested, with all backend tests passing at 100% and frontend functionality confirmed via auto-testing and visual screenshots, resolving all critical issues and ensuring production readiness for these features.
