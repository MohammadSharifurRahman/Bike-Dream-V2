The AI engineer initiated the project by outlining a 3-phase plan prioritizing core database functionality, then user engagement, and finally community features for Byke-Dream (later Bike-Dream). It leveraged  for image sourcing and  for initial full-stack implementation. The first iteration successfully created a basic motorcycle listing with search/filtering. Subsequent user feedback drove significant database expansion (to 2614+ motorcycles), implementation of a daily update bot (simulated), Emergent authentication, user ratings, comments, and favorites. The AI engineer also successfully addressed UI/UX improvements, including dynamic category navigation, refined filtering, a multi-vendor, location-based pricing system, and the Byke-Dream to Bike-Dream rename. The current focus is on a user-requested refinement of motorcycle features (renaming current ones to specialisations and adding detailed technical specifications), demonstrating an agile, iterative development cycle with continuous testing.

<product_requirements>
The Byke-Dream (now Bike-Dream) website aims to be a comprehensive platform cataloging motorcycles from 1900 to the present. Key requirements include:
1.  **Motorcycle Database**: Comprehensive data with images, specs, availability. Scaled to 2614+ motorcycles from 1900-2025, covering major manufacturers and categories.
2.  **User Authentication**: Account creation (email/password, OAuth 2.0) with guest access; Emergent authentication system implemented.
3.  **Search & Filtering**: Advanced search by manufacturer, model, year, price, engine specs, and now specialisations and detailed features.
4.  **Localization & Pricing**: Real-time localized pricing from vendors, dynamic currency conversion, and a detailed Pricing tab on motorcycle details pages with region selection.
5.  **Motorcycle Detail Page**: Detailed specs, images, 3D models (future), user ratings, comments, favorites option.
6.  **User Interaction**: Favorites list, 5-star rating system with written reviews, comment sections with threaded replies, and user profiles/dashboards implemented.
7.  **Community Features**: Community forum, virtual garage, price alerts (pending), rider groups, achievement system, trivia (pending).
8.  **Data Updates**: Daily data updates from authentic sources (00:00 GMT) via an automated bot (simulated, but operational).
9.  **User Interface**: User-friendly, responsive design with a search bar, featured carousels, category-based homepage, and quick navigation buttons. The website name has been changed to Bike-Dream.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main FastAPI application file, serving as the central API hub. It defines all backend endpoints for motorcycles (CRUD, search, filter, sort), user authentication (Emergent), ratings, comments, and favorites.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file has been extensively rewritten multiple times to accommodate new features: initial database setup, daily update bot integration, user authentication and interaction APIs, and the recent changes for Specialisation and Features filtering and display. It integrates , , and .
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: A Python script responsible for generating and managing the extensive mock motorcycle database used for seeding.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially contained a small set of motorcycles, then expanded significantly to include 1307+ motorcycles covering a wide range of manufacturers, years, and categories. Most recently, it is being updated to include detailed technical specifications for motorcycles.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Implements the simulated daily data update logic, handling periodic updates of motorcycle data, prices, and specs, including regional customizations.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to fulfill the requirement for a daily data update system, featuring API endpoints for manual trigger, status monitoring, and update history.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Manages mock vendor pricing data, providing localized and multi-vendor price information.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to implement the location-based, multi-vendor pricing system, including dynamic currency conversion and detailed vendor information.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component rendering the user interface, including the homepage, browse page, motorcycle detail modals, and navigation.
    -   **Changes Made**: Has undergone numerous rewrites to implement UI/UX improvements, display expanded data, integrate authentication components, manage ratings/comments, fix category navigation, add hero section buttons, and display multi-vendor pricing. Currently being updated to display key technical features under motorcycle cards and enable sorting by features.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Contains custom CSS for styling the application, complementing Tailwind CSS.
    -   **Changes Made**: Minor adjustments for layout and visual enhancements throughout the development.

<current_work>
The immediate work involves refining the display and filtering of motorcycle features. Based on user feedback, the previous Features filter will be renamed to Specialisation to differentiate it from actual technical specifications. The AI engineer is in the process of adding detailed technical Features for each motorcycle, which include: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .

The plan is to:
1.  **Rename Features to Specialisation**: This involves updating the backend API () and frontend UI () to reflect this name change for existing filters.
2.  **Add new Features**: Update the  database generation script to include the detailed technical specifications for each motorcycle. The AI engineer has already started this for Yamaha models.
3.  **Display key specs under motorcycle pictures**: Modify  to show , , , , , , , , , and  directly on the motorcycle cards.
4.  **Add sorting by features**: Implement backend logic in  and frontend UI in  to allow users to sort motorcycles by these new technical features.

Currently, the AI engineer has updated  to handle the renaming and API changes, and has begun updating the  file to populate the technical features for Yamaha. The trajectory indicates the next step is to continue this data population for other manufacturers like Kawasaki, Suzuki, and Ducati.
