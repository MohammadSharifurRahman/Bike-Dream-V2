<product_requirements>
The Bike-Dream application aims to be a comprehensive platform for motorcycle enthusiasts, offering detailed information and interactive features for models from 1900 to the present. Key requirements include a database of 2614+ motorcycles with images and technical specifications, robust user authentication (email/password, Google OAuth 2.0, session management), and advanced search/filtering capabilities. The platform supports localization with real-time, multi-vendor pricing for 67+ countries and 50+ currencies, including regional availability handling and realistic delivery times. User interaction features encompass personal favorites, a 5-star rating system with reviews, and threaded comment sections. Automated daily updates ensure data freshness. The user interface is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, with features like dynamic homepage metadata showing real-time motorcycle and manufacturer counts, and professional image handling with placeholders. Recent additions include a dynamic homepage image carousel, a user activity analytics page, and improved navigation. Future goals include fostering a strong community and enabling monetization strategies through enhanced regional relevance and user engagement.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on a set of improvements requested by the user, focusing on enhancing visual appeal, user engagement, community interaction, and administrative feedback tracking.

Specifically, the following tasks were in progress or just completed:
1.  **Homepage Visual Update (Sliding Carousel)**: The static blue banner on the homepage was replaced with a sliding carousel of high-quality motorcycle images. This involved selecting suitable images and updating the  file to integrate the new carousel component and replace the old hero section.
2.  **Interactive Comment and Discussion System**: A comprehensive commenting feature allowing users to post, reply, and start discussion threads under each motorcycle profile page was being implemented.
    *   **Backend**: The backend models and endpoints in  were updated and enhanced to support threaded discussions, including  class modifications and new API routes for posting/replying to comments.
    *   **Frontend**: A new  component was created in  to handle the display and interaction of comments, replacing the previous  component. The motorcycle detail modal was also updated to use this new component.
3.  **User Activity Analytics Page**: A new page accessible from the homepage and user dashboard to display user statistics (favorited motorcycles, comments posted, ratings given, discussion threads participated in) was being implemented.
    *   **Backend**: Endpoints for retrieving user activity statistics were added to .
    *   **Frontend**: The  component was implemented in  to render these statistics.
4.  **Homepage Navigation Improvement**: The visibility and positioning of the Close or Back button in the motorcycle's detail view (modal) were being improved for easier navigation back to the homepage. This task was actively being worked on when the trajectory ended.
